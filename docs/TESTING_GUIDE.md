## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: "luajit command not found"
**Solution**: Install LuaJIT and ensure it's in PATH
```bash
# macOS
brew install luajit

# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install luajit

# Windows
# Download from luajit.org and add to PATH
```

### Issue: "Failed to find valid ready banner"
**Solution**: Check POB_FORK_PATH points to correct directory
- Should contain HeadlessWrapper.lua
- Should contain Modules/ directory with PoB code

### Issue: "Timed out waiting for response"
**Solution**:
- Increase POB_TIMEOUT_MS (default 10000ms)
- Verify PoB fork installation is complete
- Check if HeadlessWrapper.lua has syntax errors

### Issue: Stats don't match PoB GUI
**Solution**:
- Verify same game version
- Check configuration (bandit, pantheon, enemy level)
- Ensure PoB fork is up-to-date

### Issue: TCP connection fails
**Solution**:
- Verify PoB GUI launched with POB_API_TCP=1
- Check firewall settings
- Verify port 31337 not in use
- Try telnet 127.0.0.1 31337 to test connection
