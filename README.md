# Path of Building MCP Server — PoE2

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables Claude to analyze, modify, and optimize **Path of Exile 2** builds using Path of Building's actual calculation engine, via the [PathOfBuilding-PoE2](https://github.com/PathOfBuildingCommunity/PathOfBuilding-PoE2) fork.

It is a port of [`pob-mcp`](../pob-mcp) (PoE1) to PoE2. The high-fidelity calculation half is driven by a headless `luajit` process running an `api-stdio` JSON bridge that was ported onto the PoE2 PoB codebase (`PathOfBuilding-PoE2/src/API/` + `HeadlessWrapper.lua` hooks).

> ### ⚠️ MVP / port status
>
> The Lua bridge foundation is **ported and verified working** against the PoE2 engine (ping, new build, tree get/set, live stat calc incl. **Spirit**, item/skill/config ops, what-if calc). The TypeScript server is a copy of the PoE1 server with PoE2-aware bridge wiring.
>
> **Validated for PoE2:** the `lua_*` engine tools (stats, tree, items, skills, config, level), and XML build analysis (PoE2 uses the same PoB XML schema).
>
> **PoE2-native additions:** `list_gems` queries Path of Building's own PoE2 gem database (skill + support gems, tags, gem family, requirements, max level) — use it for accurate gem info instead of the legacy heuristics below.
>
> **Carried over from PoE1 — needs PoE2 review before relying on it:** the heuristic skill-gem tools (`analyze_skill_links`, `suggest_support_gems`, `find_optimal_links`, etc.) still use a hand-maintained PoE1 gem DB / archetype templates and a 6-link assumption that does not match PoE2 (uncut skills + per-skill support sockets); prefer `list_gems` + the engine's own validation. Also: defensive analyzer thresholds, class/ascendancy ID tables in some tool descriptions, `poe.ninja` and Trade API endpoints (PoE1 leagues/URLs), bandit/pantheon config (does not exist in PoE2). The validation tool's life thresholds and suggestions have been retuned for PoE2. These tools still compile and run but may return PoE1-shaped assumptions.
>
> **PoE2 engine differences already handled in the bridge:** `PassiveSpec:ImportFromNodeList` signature (extra `className` / `weaponSets` params), generic config passthrough (no bandit/pantheon), flask-slot validation against the actual item set, `Spirit` in default stat export, and stdout reserved for the JSON protocol (PoB logging redirected to stderr).

## Installation

```bash
cd pob-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

## Configuration

### Claude Desktop Configuration

**Mac**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

#### XML-Only (No Lua Bridge)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pob": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/pob-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "POB_DIRECTORY": "/path/to/your/Path of Building/Builds"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Full Configuration (With Lua Bridge)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pob": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/pob-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "POB_DIRECTORY": "/path/to/your/Path of Building/Builds",
        "POB_LUA_ENABLED": "true",
        "POB_FORK_PATH": "/path/to/PathOfBuilding/src",
        "POB_CMD": "/usr/local/bin/luajit",
        "POB_TIMEOUT_MS": "10000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POB_DIRECTORY` | OS-default Builds dir | Path to your PoB builds directory |
| `POB_LUA_ENABLED` | `false` | Set `"true"` to enable Lua bridge |
| `POB_FORK_PATH` | `~/Projects/PathOfBuilding/src` | Path to PathOfBuilding/src |
| `POB_CMD` | `luajit` | LuaJIT binary path |
| `POB_TIMEOUT_MS` | `10000` | Lua request timeout (ms) |
| `POE_TRADE_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable Trade API tools |

### Setting Up the Lua Bridge

The Lua bridge uses PoB's actual calculation engine for accurate stats.

#### 1. Install LuaJIT
```bash
# macOS
brew install luajit

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install luajit

# Windows: download from https://luajit.org/ and add to PATH
```

#### 2. Get the PoE2 PoB fork with the api-stdio bridge
This repo's sibling `PathOfBuilding-PoE2/` already contains the ported api-stdio bridge
(`src/API/{Server,Handlers,BuildOps}.lua`, `src/utf8.lua`, and the `POB_API_STDIO` hooks in
`src/HeadlessWrapper.lua`). Point `POB_FORK_PATH` at its `src/` directory.

If you are setting this up from a clean upstream clone instead, copy those `src/API/` files and
`src/utf8.lua` over, and apply the `POB_API_STDIO` block from `src/HeadlessWrapper.lua` (which also
redirects PoB logging to stderr so stdout stays pure JSON).

#### 3. Verify
```bash
luajit -v
ls /path/to/PathOfBuilding/src/HeadlessWrapper.lua
```

#### 4. Update Claude Desktop config and restart Claude Desktop

- **Avoidance** — evasion, spell suppression, dodge, block
- **Mitigation** — armour/PDR, endurance charges
- **Recovery** — life regen (≥1%/s), leech, ES recharge

A build with all 3 layers is considered exceptional.

### Configuration & Enemy Settings

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `get_config` | View bandit, pantheon, and enemy settings |
| `set_config` | Toggle charges, buffs, conditions (e.g. `usePowerCharges`, `enemyIsBoss`) |

### Build Validation

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `validate_build` | Check resistances, life, defensive layers, mana, immunities, accuracy, damage scaling |

Returns critical issues, warnings, and info with actionable suggestions and an overall 0–10 health score. Uses Lua bridge stats when available; falls back to XML parsing. `build_name` is optional — omitting it validates the currently loaded Lua bridge build.

| `export_build_summary` | Export a human-readable build summary |

Snapshots are stored in `POB_DIRECTORY/.pob-mcp/snapshots/`.

## Typical Workflows

### Analyze an existing build
```
1. lua_start
2. lua_load_build (build_name: "MyBuild.xml")
3. lua_get_stats (category: "defense")
4. validate_build
5. analyze_defenses (build_name: "MyBuild.xml")
```

### Build from scratch
```
1. lua_start
2. lua_new_build (class_name: "Witch", ascendancy: "Necromancer")
3. setup_skill_with_gems (active_gem: "Summon Skeletons", support_gems: [...])
4. lua_set_tree (nodes: [...])
5. lua_get_stats
6. lua_save_build (build_name: "MySummoner.xml")
```

### Optimize passive tree
```
1. lua_load_build (build_name: "MyBuild.xml")
2. suggest_optimal_nodes (goal: "life", points_available: 5)
3. search_tree_nodes (query: "maximum life")
4. lua_get_tree   ← copy current node list
5. lua_set_tree   ← add new nodes to the list
6. lua_get_stats  ← verify improvement
7. lua_save_build ← persist
```

### Test DPS against Shaper
```
1. lua_load_build
2. set_enemy_stats (level: 84, fire_resist: 40, cold_resist: 40, lightning_resist: 40)
3. set_config (config_name: "enemyIsBoss", value: true)
4. lua_get_stats (category: "offense")
```

## Troubleshooting

### XML Features

**No builds found**
- Verify `POB_DIRECTORY` is correct and contains `.xml` files
- Check file permissions

**Parse errors**
- Open the build in PoB GUI to verify it isn't corrupted
- Ensure PoB is up to date

### Lua Bridge

**`luajit command not found`**
```bash
brew install luajit          # macOS
sudo apt-get install luajit  # Ubuntu/Debian
```
Or set `POB_CMD` to the full path (e.g., `/opt/homebrew/bin/luajit`).

**`Failed to find valid ready banner`**
`POB_FORK_PATH` must point to the directory containing `HeadlessWrapper.lua`:
```bash
ls "$POB_FORK_PATH/HeadlessWrapper.lua"   # must exist
ls "$POB_FORK_PATH/Modules/"              # must exist
```

**`Timed out waiting for response`**
- Increase `POB_TIMEOUT_MS` (try `20000`)
- Test manually: `cd "$POB_FORK_PATH" && luajit HeadlessWrapper.lua`

**Stats don't match PoB GUI**
- Check bandit/pantheon/enemy settings with `get_config`
- Ensure the correct tree spec is active in the XML
- Make sure your PathOfBuilding fork is on the `api-stdio` branch and up to date

**Bridge becomes unresponsive**
```
lua_stop → wait a moment → lua_start
```
If still unresponsive, restart Claude Desktop.

**Nodes dropped after `lua_set_tree`**
Nodes must form a valid connected path from the class starting node. Disconnected nodes are silently dropped by PoB. Ensure all intermediate nodes are included.

**`lua_save_build` doesn't persist gem changes**
Gem modifications made via `add_gem`, `set_gem_level`, `set_gem_quality` are currently held in Lua memory and are not serialized back to the XML on save. This is a known limitation.

---

## Development

```bash
npm run build   # compile TypeScript
npm run dev     # watch mode
```

## Path of Building XML Structure

PoB builds are XML files with:
- `<Build>`: Character info and stats
- `<Tree>`: Passive skill tree node allocations
- `<Skills>`: Socket groups and gem links
- `<Items>`: Equipped items
- `<Notes>`: Build notes
